Projects and PSETs from Econ Master's at UChicago

I took Advanced Industrial Organization during the winter. It was a computationally intensive class. I've uploaded a part of first PSET which was a collaborative effort between me and Eric Karsten replicating the algorithm of BLP 1995.

I took Firm Dynamics and Economic Growth. I've uploaded the final research proposal project for that class. I attempted to calculate the sectoral distance between acquiring and acquiree firms in the start-up/tech space. 

In Spring Quarter I took Economic Development from Harris School of Public Policy. Although it is not very computationally intensive, it does feature some coding output and examples of visualization in R.
